Question 1:
Which of the following Java variable declarations has an error?
*/

A.	int x = 5;
B.	double temperature = 75.6;
C.	char grade = ’A’;
D.	String name = ’Adam’;

/*

Answer = D.

When deﬁning Strings, we need to use double quotes around the text, like this: String name = "Adam";
Single quotes are used for deﬁning single characters, like this:
char grade = ’A’;
